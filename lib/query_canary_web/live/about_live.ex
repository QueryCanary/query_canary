      <p>
        QueryCanary was built out of a very real problem: discovering your production data is brokenâ€¦ days too late.
        Whether itâ€™s a metric that silently flatlines, signups that drop and go unnoticed, or a
        <code>NULL</code>
        where there
        shouldnâ€™t be â€” the data broke, and no one knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        I built QueryCanary to give developers and data teams an early warning system for their production databases.
        It's lightweight, SQL-powered, and designed to help you define integrity checks you care about â€” like low signups,
        broken joins, or invalid prices â€” and then get alerted when things drift off course.
      </p>

      <p>
        It started as a personal tool to make sure I didn't get blindsided at work by broken analytics. Now it's
        a fully functional micro-SaaS, used in production to monitor real systems â€” quietly catching issues before they become
        problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        QueryCanary supports scheduled SQL checks, anomaly detection, SSH-tunneled Postgres connections, email alerts,  teams, and a simple dashboard. Itâ€™s still early, but Iâ€™m actively building, shipping,
        and listening.
